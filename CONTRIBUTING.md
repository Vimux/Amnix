# Contributing to Amnix

Looking to contribute something to **Amnix** theme? Bug reports and code patches are welcome.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone
involved.

## Issues

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/vimux/amnix/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports and features
requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** combine a few problems or features in one issue. Create separate issues if needed.
* Please **do not** create issue that contains title only. Write useful title and description.
* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or emoji. Use
[GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead.
The project maintainer reserve the right to delete such comments.
* Please specify the exact steps to reproduce bug.

## Pull requests (PR)

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features or refactoring code),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project maintainer might not want to merge into
the project.

**IMPORTANT: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the terms of the
[MIT License](LICENSE).**
